What is your name: drake

You can hear owls hooting and unknown creatures flitting in the underbrush.
A thick layer of fog has descended upon the valley making it difficult for
your horse to find her footing. You pass a carriage house that has long
since seen any passengers. You know the house is not far from here. You can
hear a wolf howl in distance as the ancient keep suddenly emerges from the fog
as if it were expecting you. The ancient brick and stone walls are covered in
ivy. The house, Ravenscroft Keep, is the ancestral seat of the once proud and
ancient Ravenscroft family. The last inhabitant of the house passed recently.
The last scion of an ancient and noble family, Albert Ravenscroft, was your
friend from Oxford. You smile wryly as you remember your university days
together. The main line, now extinct, has passed to distant cousin and on his
behalf are here to settle the estate. They have sent you here to determine if
the estate is even worth keeping. You get off your horse, tie him to the gate,
and remove your belongings from the saddle bags. As you walk up to the door the
gargoyles seem to peer down at you with contempt. You knock on the door using the
bronze door knocker. Irving, Albert's personal valet, answers the door and invites
you in.

"I've been expecting you, mister Drake" Irvine croaked as he takes your hat and coat
caked stiff with dust and damp
from the long, cold ride from London.
"Hello Irving, It's been too long. It's been at least 15 years since I was last here
visiting Bertie," I tried to say as cheerfully as possible.
"How are the other staff: Elias, Edith, Bess, and Eliza?" I asked.
"They left directly after mister Ravenscroft passed." Irving said brusquely.
"Shame. So, it's just you then?" I asked.
"It is, sir. I've also been instructed to give you free reign of the place." He replied.
"Thank you, Irving, I will be retiring to room and then look at the rest of the house."

You've unpacked your bags and changed out of your riding clothes and decideto start at
the entrance of the manse.
